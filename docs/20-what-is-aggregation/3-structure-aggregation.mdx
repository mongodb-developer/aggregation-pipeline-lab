# ðŸ“˜ Structure of an Aggregation Pipeline

To interact with a relational database, we typically use SQL, a fourth-generation language, to access our data. With MongoDB, we instead get data and transform it in incremental steps.

An aggregation pipeline is composed of [__stages__](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/).

We pass an array of stages to the `aggregate` method like so:

```
db.mycollection.aggregate([
    stage1,
    stage2,
    stage3
])
```

## Example

```
// Inside the current database, in the collection named reviews
db.reviews.aggregate([
  { 
    // group all reviews for the same book
    $group: {
        _id: "$bookId",
        averageRating: {
          $avg: "$rating",
        },
      },
  },
  // filter out all reviews that have an average other than 5
  { $match: { averageRating: 5 } },
  // JOIN with author collection to get all the author info
  { $lookup: {
        from: "authors",
        localField: "_id",
        foreignField: "books",
        as: "author",
      },
  },
  // add a field called bio
  {$addFields: {
    bio: "$author.bio"
  }},
])
```
