# ðŸ“˜ SQL vs Aggregations

## SQL

A SQL query statement usually starts with a `SELECT` where we put a list of the fields we need, then a `FROM` clause to state the table/s (or in this case, the subquery) that will return the rows. We can filter out using `WHERE` and group data using `GROUP`.

We read this from the inside. If there's too much nesting, it's not easy to follow.


### Get authorsâ€™ bios with books that have an average 5-star rating

```SQL
SELECT authors.name, authors.bio
FROM library.authors authors
JOIN library.author_book author_book_join ON authors.id = author_book_join.author_id
JOIN (
    SELECT books.id
    FROM library.books books
    JOIN library.reviews reviews ON books.id = reviews.book_id
    GROUP BY books.id
    HAVING AVG(reviews.rating) = 5
) five_star_books ON author_book_join.book_id = five_star_books.id;


```

### Get annual, average, and max spending from customers in all cities

```SQL
SELECT
    city,
    SUM(annual_spend) Total_Spend,
    AVG(annual_spend) Average_Spend,
    MAX(annual_spend) Max_Spend,
    COUNT(annual_spend) customers
FROM (
    SELECT t1.city, customer.annual_spend
    FROM customer 
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT address.address_id, city.city,
               address.customer_id, address.location
        FROM address LEFT JOIN city
        ON address.city_id = city.city_id
        ) AS t1
    ON
    (customer.customer_id = t1.customer_id AND
              t1.location = "home")
) AS t2
GROUP BY city;
```

## Equivalent MongoDB aggregation pipeline


### Get authorsâ€™ bios with books that have an average 5-star rating

We go through four stages:
- Group all the reviews for every book, calculating the average rating.
- Filter out all average ratings other than 5.
- Now we have reviews with 5 stars, but we also want the author bio, so we join with author to get the bio.
- We add a new field called `bio` with just the author's bio. 

```js
db.reviews.aggregate([
  { 
    $group: {
        _id: "$bookId",
        averageRating: {
          $avg: "$rating",
        },
      },
  },
  { $match: { averageRating: 5 } },
  { $lookup: {
        from: "authors",
        localField: "_id",
        foreignField: "books",
        as: "author",
      },
  },
  {$addFields: {
    bio: "$author.bio"
  }},
])


```


### Get annual, average, and max spending from customers in all cities

Here we pass three stages: one to return one document per element in the `address` array, and then we filter out to get only the documents that have a `home` address location. Finally, we do the grouping. As we'll see, this can be split and tested separately and resembles our code. 

```js
db.customers.aggregate([
	{
		$unwind: "$address",
	},
	{
		$match: {"address.location": "home"}
	},
	{
		 $group: {
			_id: "$address.city",
			totalSpend: {$sum: "$annualSpend"},
			averageSpend: {$avg: "$annualSpend"},
			maximumSpend: {$max: "$annualSpend"},
			customers: {$sum: 1}
		}
	}
])
```
