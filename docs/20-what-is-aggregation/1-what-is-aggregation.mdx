Construct modular, composable processing pipelines

An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents:

Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.

The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.

An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.
