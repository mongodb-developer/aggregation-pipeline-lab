# 👐 Group

We can sum all the pages for all books in each year:

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    {$group:{
        _id: "$year",
        totalPages: {$sum: "$pages"}
    }}
])
```

Here, we group by book's `year` (the _id of the grouping), and then we create a new field called `totalPages` that's the sum of all pages.

👐 Can you get the results ordered ascending by year?
