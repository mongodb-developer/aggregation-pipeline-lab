# 👐 Searching inside Objects in arrays

In the books collection, we're using the [Attribute Pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/attribute-pattern/) to store different attributes in our documents. As we can see in the [sample doc](/docs/simple-queries/project), we have an `attributes` array, containing several objects, each with the same structure:

```js
attributes: [
    {
      key: 'edition',
      value: '1st'
    },
    {
      key: 'dimensions',
      value: 'Height: 1.111 Inches, Length: 1.111 Inches, Weight: 0.2 Pounds, Width: 1.111 Inches'
    },
    {
      key: 'isbn13',
      value: '9780765342508'
    },
    {
      key: 'msrp',
      value: 6.99
    },
    {
      key: 'isbn',
      value: '0765342502'
    },
    {
      key: 'isbn10',
      value: '0765342502'
    }
  ],
```

How do we search for all the books that have an msrp of 9.99? We want books that, inside `attributes` has an object with key `msrp` and value `9.99`. We can get it to work with this:

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    { $unwind : "$attributes" },
    {$match: {"attributes.key": "msrp", "attributes.value": 9.99} },
   {$project: {title: 1, attributes: 1}}
]);
```

Here we're getting a copy of each book for each object inside the `$attributes` array. This "flattens" the array and returns many copies of the same documents, one for each different attribute that we have which will be different for each of these generated docs.

👐 To better understand `$unwind`, run this aggregation

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  { $match: {_id: "0395623650"} },
  { $unwind : "$attributes" },
]);
```
You should get one document per attribute of the original book.

But you can actually match documents in an array in a more straightforward fashion:

```js
let nineNinetyNine = {$match: {"attributes.key": "msrp", "attributes.value": 9.99}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1, "attributes": 1}};

db.books.aggregate([
    nineNinetyNine,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
]);
```
