description: Setting up your MongoDB Atlas account, importing Library data 
---

# 👐 Set up lab

To follow along, you'll need:
- A MongoDB Atlas account.
- Test data. In this case, this is `book`, `author`, and `review` data for a library management system.

👐 To get this data set, open the [intro lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/intro) and follow it to get your database ready. (Only do sections `MongoDB Atlas` and `Importing Data`. This should take you 10 to 15 minutes.)

Return here when finished!
