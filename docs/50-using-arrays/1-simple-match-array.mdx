# Simple Array queries

## Find data in arrays

A JSON Array can contain scalar values or objects. In our data, `authors` have an array of the books they've authored (their ISBNs). Let's get one author:


```js
db.authors.aggregate([{$limit: 1}])
```

💻 Run this aggregation to get one author

I got this one (can change depending on the data source you imported)

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("64cc2db4830ba29148da4c3b"),
  name: 'Richard Bruce Wright',
  sanitizedName: 'richardbrucewright',
  books: [
    '0002005018',
    '0771597185'
  ],
  aliases: [
    'Wright, Richard Bruce'
  ]
}
```

Can I get all authors for book `0002005018`? For that, I want all authors that have `0002005018` inside the `books` array. Turns out it's quite simple:

```js
db.authors.aggregate([
    {$match: {books: "0002005018"}}
])
```

<div>

```js
db.authors.aggregate([{$match: {books: "9780439139595"}}])

>   name: 'J.K. Rowling',
```
</div>
</details>

## Size of an array

What if we want to know how many aliases an Author has? To do that we can use `$size`, adding the array field that we're interested in:

```js
db.authors.aggregate([
{$project: {
    name: 1,
    bookCount: {$size: "$books"}
 }
},
])
```

💻 Who wrote the most books?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
let addNumberBooks = {
    $project: {
        name: 1,
        bookCount: {$size: "$books"}
    }
}

let orderByNumberOfBooksDesc = { $sort: {"bookCount": -1}}

let getOne = {$limit: 1}

db.authors.aggregate([
    
    addNumberBooks,
    orderByNumberOfBooksDesc,
    getOne,
])
```
</div>
</details>
