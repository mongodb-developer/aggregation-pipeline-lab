# 👐 Adding New Fields to Results

## $addFields

We want to estimate the reading time for a book. But we don't have that field stored in our data. We can use `$addFields` for this. If the field exists, it'll get updated, and if it doesn't, it's added.

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    {$project: {
        title: 1,
        pages: 1,
        }
    },
    {$addFields: {readingTimeHours: {$divide: [{$multiply: ["$pages", 2]}, 60]}}},
])
```

👐 Add a new field, `notes`, that contains the text `PLACEHOLDER` for all documents.

        pages: 1,
        
    }
    
    },

    {$addFields: {notes: "PLACEHOLDER"}}
])
```
