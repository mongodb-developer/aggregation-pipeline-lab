# ðŸ¦¸ Missing Data

Sometimes, we're missing a field we're looking for (it's not there, as documents in a collection can be polymorphic, so this field is `null`). For these cases, we can check if something is there using `$ifNull` and add a default value.

```js
let getAuthorsWithBooks = {
    $project: {
        name: 1,
        books: { $ifNull: ["$books", []]},
    }
}

db.authors.aggregate([
    getAuthorsWithBooks,
])
```
