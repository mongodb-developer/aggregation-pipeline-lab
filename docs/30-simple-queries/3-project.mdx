## Including fields in a projection 

A document from the `books` collection looks like:

```js

  _id: '0395623650',
  title: 'Platero y yo / Platero and I (Spanish-English Bilingual Edition) (English and Spanish Edition)',

    {

  ],

```

If we're interested in the titles, we can use `$project` to select just the fields we're interested in. As an example, to get just the book's title and year, we'll write:


<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
  <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">
```js
[
  {
    $project: { title: 1, year: 1 }
  }
]
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $project: { title: 1, year: 1 }
  }
])
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


- 1 means "show that field.". Once you started an inclusion projection you can't exclude other fields (you just keep adding the fields you want to see)
- 0 means "hide that field.". Once you started an exclusion projection you can't include other fields (you just keep adding the fields you don't want to see)
- The primary key `_id` field is shown by default.

So we can exclude fields and show all fields except `attributes` using:

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
  <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">
```js
[
  {
    $project: { attributes: 0 }
  }
]
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">
```js
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $project: { attributes: 0 }
  }
])
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


üëê Show only `title` and `cover`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $project: { title: 1, cover: 1 }
  }
])
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>
</details>

## Excluding fields

üëê Exclude the `cover`, `attributes`, and `_id` fields from the result.

## Including and excluding fields

:::danger

You can't include and exclude fields in the same projection. If you start including, you must keep including, and vice versa.

:::

For instance, this will fail:

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {title: 1, attributes: 0}}])

MongoServerError: Invalid $project :: caused by :: Cannot do exclusion on field attributes in inclusion projection
```

:::info

The only exception to this rule is the `_id` field, which we can exclude in an inclusion projection.

:::

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$project: {title: 1, _id: 0}}])
```
