# 🦸‍♂️ Repeating Stages

:::info
Extra activity! Do it if you have extra time or are following along at home. It won't be covered during the hands-on lab.

From the [aggregation pipelines manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/#stages):

> All stages except the $out, $merge, $geoNear, $changeStream, and $changeStreamSplitLargeEvent stages can appear multiple times in a pipeline.

So we can repeat most stages, and do something like this to get all books from 1985 with more than 100 pages (although it may or may not make sense):
<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
  <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

```js
[
    {
        $match: { pages: {$gte: 100} }
    },
    {
        $match: { year: 1985 }
    }
]
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

```js
db.books.aggregate([{$match: {pages: {$gte: 100}}}, {$match: {year: 1985}}])
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



💻 Add several `$limit` stages at the end of the above aggregation, limiting to 1 book, and see what happens.
