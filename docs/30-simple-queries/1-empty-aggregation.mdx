# üëê Empty Aggregation Pipeline

## An empty aggregation

This code is the equivalent of a `SELECT * FROM AUTHORS`. It returns a [cursor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/) with all documents in the `authors` collection:

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">

 <TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

<Screenshot src="/img/30-simple-queries/atlas-aggregation.png" url="http://cloud.mongodb.com/" alt="Atlas UI showing an empty aggregation pipeline" />

- Make sure `Collections` > `authors` is selected.
- Open the `Aggregation` tab.
- Select `Text`.
- Notice the empty array in the editor denoting an empty aggregation pipeline:

```js
[]
```

You're getting all documents in `authors` (although the Atlas UI is only showing a 10-documents sample) 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

```js
db.authors.aggregate([])
```

We can iterate over the returned cursor and get more documents by typing `it`. 

üëê Return all the documents in the `books` collection and iterate to get the next page of books.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cursor methods

:::info
Extra activity! Do it if you have extra time or are following along at home. It won't be covered during the hands-on lab.
:::

A [cursor](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/) has several useful methods. For instance, we can check the size of the returned cursor with `itcount`.

```js
cursor.itcount()
```

üëê In our previous example with the empty aggregation, to check the size of the returned cursor, what should we type in?

<div>

```js
// as db.books.aggregate([]) returns a cursor we can just call itcount() on it
db.books.aggregate([]).itcount()
```
</div>
</details>

  </TabItem>
 
</Tabs>
