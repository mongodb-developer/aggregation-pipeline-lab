We get this request: Write a `$lookup` to get `name` and `bio` from author's information inside each book document. To get this done, we need to review several things:

- Each book can have several authors. This many-to-many relationship (as an author can also write many books) is modeled using two different arrays: a `books` array in the `authors` collection and an `authors` array in the `books` collection.
- So we'll need to get a separate document for each book that has more than one author. If a book has three authors, we'll use `$unwind` to get three documents with the same data except for the author, which will be each of the three authors.

You can try this with this aggregation pipeline:

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    // as a book can have many authors, we get one doc per book's author
    {$unwind: "$authors"},
    // remove some noisy fields
    {$project: {attributes: 0, reviews: 0}}
])
```
- Now, we need to get the authors' information. For that, we'll use `$lookup`, linking the `_id` in the `authors` collection with the `_id` we have in each book's `authors` array. But as we can see here, these have a different type: The ones inside our array are strings, while the `author` collection `_id` are `ObjectId`.

```js
  authors: {
    _id: '64cc2db4830ba29148da64a2',
    name: 'Timothy Findley'
  },
```

So we need to convert from `String` into `ObjectId`. We can do that using `$toObjectId`. This will add a new field, `authorId`, converting it into `ObjectId`:

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    // as a book can have many authors, we get one doc per book's author
    {$unwind: "$authors"},
    // convert it to an objectId
    {"$set":{"authorId":{"$toObjectId":"$authors._id"}}},
    // remove some noisy fields
    {$project: {attributes: 0, reviews: 0}}
])
```

- Now, we're ready to do the `$lookup`: We want all documents from `authors` that have the same `_id` as the `authorId` we just created. We use a `pipeline` to get just `authors` `name` and `bio`.

```js
db.books.aggregate([
    // as a book can have many authors, we get one doc per book's author
    {$unwind: "$authors"},
    // convert it to an objectId
    {"$set":{"authorId":{"$toObjectId":"$authors._id"}}},
    {$lookup: {
       from: "authors",
       localField: "authorId",
       foreignField: "_id",
       pipeline: [
            {$project: {name: 1, bio: 1}},
       ],
       as: "bookAuthorDetails"
     } 
    },
    // remove some noisy fields
    {$project: {attributes: 0, reviews: 0}}
])
```
