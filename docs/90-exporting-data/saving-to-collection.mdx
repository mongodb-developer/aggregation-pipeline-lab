# ü¶∏ Saving to a Collection

# $out

You can export the result of an aggregation pipeline to a different DB/collection. To do that, just add a last aggregation stage `$out` to your pipeline:

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
<TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

Run this from the source collection:

```js
[{ $out: { db: "<output-db>", coll: "<output-collection>" } }]
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

```js
db.sourceCollection.aggregate[{ $out: { db: "<output-db>", coll: "<output-collection>" } }]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



You can omit the `db` attribute, and the new collection will be created in the current DB.

```js
{ $out: "<output-collection>" }
```

:::info
The `$out` stage must be the last stage in the pipeline.
:::


üëê Create a copy of the books with exactly 100 pages and output as a new collection named `OneHundredPagesBooks`.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

<Tabs groupId="aggregations">
<TabItem value="atlas" label="Atlas UI">

```js
[
    {$match: {pages: 100}},
    {$out: "OneHundredPagesBooks"}
]
```

Refresh the database to see the new collection.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mongodb-shell" label="MongoDB Shell">

```js
let oneHundredPagesBooks = {$match: {pages: 100}};
let saveToNewCollection = {$out: "OneHundredPagesBooks"}

db.books.aggregate([
    oneHundredPagesBooks,
    saveToNewCollection
]);
```

After running this, we should see a new collection with:

```js
show collections
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



</div>
</details>

Reference: [üìó `$out` documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/out/) 

## Merging output results

If the collection specified by the `$out` operation already exists, then the `$out` stage atomically replaces the existing collection with the new results collection upon completion of the aggregation.

To avoid overwriting the existing collection, we can use `$merge` instead of `$out`.

```
{ $merge : { into : "newCollection" } }
```

- If the collection does not exist, it will be created.
- If it exists, new data will be added.
- If [a doc already exists](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#std-label-merge-whenMatched), we can replace it, keep the existing one, merge both documents, and cause the stage to fail or run a pipeline.

This is perfect for creating [on-demand materialized views](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/materialized-views/)

As an example, let's say we want the authors to contain all the books they've written, with all the book information. In this case, we'll do a `$lookup` to get the book information into the authors collection. We can even use the name `books` for the resulting data we're joining, shadowing the original `books` array we have in authors. This way, it will look like the `books` array changes.

```js
[
    {$lookup: {
        from: "books",
        localField: "books",
        foreignField: "_id",
        as: "books"
      } 
    },
]
```

Now, a book will look like this. You can see that the books array has been "overwritten" by the `$lookup`.

        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "aliases": [
    "Wright, Richard Bruce"
  ]
}
```

We can go ahead and remove the authors from the books array, as it is redundant:

```js
[
  {$lookup: {
      from: "books",
      localField: "books",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "books"
    } 
  },
  {$unset: 'books.authors'},
]
```

Now that our authors look the way we want, we can overwrite the authors collection using `$merge`.

```js
[
	{$lookup: {
      from: "books",
      localField: "books",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "books"
    } 
  },
  {$unset: 'books.authors'},
  {$merge: {
    into: 'authors',
    on: '_id',
    whenMatched: 'replace',
  }}
]
```

- We use the `_id` field to match documents.
- We replace the existing ones with `replace`.

:::warning
We should see a message telling us that the $merge operator will cause the pipeline to persist the results to the specified location. This stage changes data.
