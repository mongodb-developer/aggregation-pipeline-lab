# üëê Sorting

We can sort our results using the `$sort` stage. We need to sort on a field, being 1 ascending and -1 descending order.

üëê Let's get all books from 1984, sorted by number of pages. We'll only show the title, pages, and authors.

```js
let booksFrom1984 = {$match: {year: 1984}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, pages: 1, authors: 1}};
let slimmerBooksFirst = {$sort: {"pages": 1}}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1984,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    slimmerBooksFirst,
]);
```

As we can see, books with no `pages` info appear first. These documents don't have that information. Hence, `pages` is `null` and gets sorted as less than any number. 

üëê We can sort the other way around:

```js
let booksFrom1984 = {$match: {year: 1984}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, pages: 1, authors: 1}};
let thickerBooksFirst = {$sort: {"pages": -1}}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1984,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    thickerBooksFirst,
]);
```

üëê How can we get the thickest book from 1984?
