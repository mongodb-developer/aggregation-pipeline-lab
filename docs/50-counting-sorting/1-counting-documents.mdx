# üëê $count

How can we be sure that this pipeline is returning exactly 15 books?

```js
let moreThan150pages =  {pages: {$gte: 150}}
let booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages = {$match: {$and: [{year: 1985}, moreThan150pages]}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 15};

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books,
]);
```

By counting the books! Let's add a new stage to the pipeline to count those books:

```js
let moreThan150pages =  {pages: {$gte: 150}}
let booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages = {$match: {$and: [{year: 1985}, moreThan150pages]}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 15};
let count = {$count: "totalBooks"}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books,
    count,
]);
```

Here, `$count` will count the resulting docs and will return a document with just one field: `totalBooks`.

```js
{
  totalBooks: 15
}
```


üëê How many authors do we have in our `authors` collection?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>

```js
db.authors.aggregate([{$count: "authorCount"}])
```
</div>
</details>

## The order of stages is important

If we count after the `$match` stage, the document we're passing to the next steps contains only the `totalBooks` field. So the `$project` stage will return an empty document.

```js
let moreThan150pages =  {pages: {$gte: 150}}
let booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages = {$match: {$and: [{year: 1985}, moreThan150pages]}};
let showOnlyTheseFields = {$project: {_id: 0, title: 1, year: 1, totalInventory: 1, available: 1}};
let getJust15books =  {$limit: 15};
let count = {$count: "totalBooks"}

db.books.aggregate([
    booksFrom1985WithMoreThan150pages,
    count,
    showOnlyTheseFields,
    getJust15books,
]);
```
